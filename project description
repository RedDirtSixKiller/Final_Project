Final Project Stuff:

Machine learning to predict failures on a big population of devices.

Techs:Pandas, SQL, Tableau

Get module failure data
Best feature selection
Run a few models of module failure
Make some neat graphs
do some FTE calcs

Run model up to Dec2018 to see how it predicted 2019 and compare to actual

Claculating the Fails in 1 year was very accurate
Clac the #months to failure, much less accurate.

Run the survival model
Get an NN class w/ logistic survival models

Graphs comparing the model past accuracy
Graphs looking at future predictions

smooth out the zeros in the failure model.

Graphs showing hours and FTEs. Calc FTEs as step function

Get the current age of the modules portfolio.
